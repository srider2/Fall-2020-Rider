    <p>The Sea of Faith </p>
    <p>Was once, too, at the full, and round earthâ€™s shore </p>
    <p>Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. </p>
    <p>But now I only hear </p>
    <p>Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, </p>
    <p>Retreating, to the breath </p>
    <p>Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear </p>
    <p>And naked shingles of the world. </p>
