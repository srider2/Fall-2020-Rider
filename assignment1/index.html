  <h2>Physical Description</h2>

  </div>
  <div class="text1">
    <p>Red pandas can be identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage within</p>
    <p>the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white</p>
    <p>lichens. They have large, round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears. Their faces are white</p>
    <p>with reddish-brown “tear” marks that extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings</p>
    <p>help keep the sun out of their eyes. Their tails are marked with alternating red and buff rings, and</p>
    <p>they have a soft, dense woolly undercoat covered by long, coarse guard hairs. Long, bushy tails</p>
    <p>help these arboreal animals maintain balance and protect them from harsh cold and winds. Dense</p>
    <p>fur completely covers their feet which have five, widely separated toes and semi-retractable claws.</p>
    <p>The red panda tests odors using the underside of its tongue, which has a cone-like structure for</p>
    <p>collecting liquid and bringing it close to a gland inside its mouth, being the only carnivore with this</p>
    <p>adaptation. They are skilled climbers, and their ankles are extremely flexible, making it possible for</p>
    <p>them to adeptly climb headfirst down tree trunks. In contrast with other carnivores their size, red</p>
    <p>pandas have extremely robust dentition. They have a simple carnivore stomach, and share the</p>
    <p>giant panda’s pseudo-thumb, a modified wrist bone used to grasp bamboo when feeding.</p>

  <h2 id="head2">Habitat And Diet</h2>
  <div class="imgbox2">
    <img class="diet" src="images/eating.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="text2">
    <p>Red pandas live in high-altitude, temperate forests with bamboo understories in the</p>
    <p>Himalayas and other high mountains. They range from northern Myanmar to the west</p>
    <p>Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces of China. They are also found in suitable habitat in</p>
    <p>Nepal, India and Tibet.</p>

    <p id="part">Bamboo constitutes about 95% of the red panda's diet. Unlike giant pandas that feed on</p>
    <p>nearly every above-ground portion of bamboo, red pandas feed selectively on the most</p>
    <p>nutritious leaf tips and, when available, tender shoots. Like giant pandas, red pandas</p>
    <p>grasp plant stems using their forepaws and shear selected leaves off with their mouths.</p>
    <p>Because red pandas are obligate bamboo eaters, they are on a tight energy budget for</p>
    <p>much of the year. They may also forage for roots, succulent grasses, fruits, insects and</p>
    <p>grubs, and are known to occasionally kill and eat birds and small mammals.</p>

  <h2 id="head3">Sleep Habits</h2>

  </div>
  <div class="text3">
    <p>In human care, red pandas can be active at any time of day but are primarily</p>
    <p>crepuscular, or most active at dawn and dusk. On average, they spend about 45</p>
    <p>percent of the day awake and tend to be more active in cooler weather, especially</p>
    <p>during the winter mating season. In significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can</p>
    <p>become dormant, lowering their metabolic rate and raising it every few hours as they</p>
    <p>wake up to look for food.</p>

    <p id="part">This adaptation allows red pandas to spend nearly as little energy as sloths, which</p>
    <p>is very beneficial considering the low nutrition content of their diet. They also exhibit</p>
    <p>temperature-regulating behaviors, such as curling into a tight ball to conserve body</p>
    <p>heat and energy expenditure in the cold. Conversely, when temperatures are warm,</p>
    <p id="bottom">red pandas stretch out on branches and pant to lower their body temperature.</p>
