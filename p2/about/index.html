    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo, and became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa established his
    feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the
    world's most populous cities and with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and
    capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. The city's history
    be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many museums, historic temples and gardens.</p>

    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <p>If you're coming from somewhere faraway,
    you will almost certainly fly into Narita
    Airport, or into the centrally located
    Haneda Airport. But air travel isn't the only
    way to get to Tokyo. If you're coming from
    elsewhere in Japan, you have plenty of
    other options: the bullet train, other
    express trains, long-distance buses, and
    ferries.</p>
    <p>No matter which mode of transportation
    you take, you won't have any trouble
    getting to and going around central Tokyo,
    thanks to the impeccable subway system.
    Take advantage of the endless lines
    spanning across the city to get to
    wherever your trip takes you to.</p>
