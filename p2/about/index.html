      <p>If you're coming from somewhere faraway,you will almost certainly fly into Narita Airport, or into the centrally located Haneda Airport. But air</p>
      <p>travel isn't the only way to get to Tokyo. If you're coming from elsewhere in Japan, you have plenty of other options: the bullet train, other</p>
      <p>express trains, long-distance buses, and ferries.</p>
      <p>No matter which mode of transportation you take, you won't have any trouble getting to and going around central Tokyo,thanks to the impeccable<p>
      <p>subway system.Take advantage of the endless lines spanning across the city to get to wherever your trip takes you to.</p>
